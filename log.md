### Day 1: June 17, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on command line and git commands using the terminal.

**Thoughts** It gave me some tough moments that I just want to close my laptop and do some other thing, well I believe that with constant practice I would be able to get at it and definately become a pro with branching and merging my works using github.
