### Day 1: June 17, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on command line and git commands using the terminal.

**Thoughts** It gave me some tough moments that I just want to close my laptop and do some other thing, well I believe that with constant practice I would be able to get at it and definitely become a pro with branching and merging my works using github.

### Day 2 & 3: June 18 - 19 , Saturday - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've not been able to code for a complete 2 days because I traveled to a new city in my country and I needed to settle before I could continue with my coding journey.

**Thoughts** It gave me some tough moments that I just want to close my laptop and do some other thing, well I believe that with constant practice I would be able to get at it and definitely become a pro with branching and merging my works using github.

### Day 4: June 20, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Took some time off to review my plan for the 100DaysOfCode Challenge and Did some study too.

**Thoughts** Its really hard to start and keep at a thing, most times constant motivation is a necessary factor.. well let's code atleast 1 hours every day that's the goal.

### Day 5: June 21, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Was able to revisit my git commands hence working on branching and merging branches

**Thoughts** It's really fun being able to work on a project together with your peers or co-workers and learning git gives you the leverage to execute such.

### Day 6: June 22, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Attempted some projects on the ALX AFrica Software Engineeering Program

**Thoughts** Tying a project to any skill you are learning gives you a first hand approach to the skill hence giving you the experience and understanding you need for that skill

**Thoughts** I plan to create a JavaScript Component Using both VanillaJs and ReactJs for eac project hence having them documented via an index file for visibility purposes

### Day 8: June 24, Friday

### Day 9: June 25, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Went for a tech event at #IOextendedph22 GDG Community

**Thoughts** The event really worth my time and I learnt a lot, however, a striking moment for me was when one of the speakers dealt on Functional Programming. Figured that functional programming is declarative in nature and not imperative in the sense that you don't need to bother yourself with how the codes works as far as it's giving you the end result you so desire.

### Day 10: June 26, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started Working on a new project with Reactjs and tailwindCSS

**Thoughts**: This is my first time of working with tailwindCSS and I am doing this with react, however, in this 100DaysOfCOde challenge I am set to do all my frontend projects with tailwindCSS. This will further help me to grasp all the basic utilities of TailwindCSS hence perfecting my ReactJS Skills.

### Day 11: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the authentication page

**Thoughts**: Haven worked with TailwindCss I think and I know that future projects will be done using tailwindCss. I think I love the flow and how easy it is to add responsiveness to your elements.

### Day 12: June 28, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Responsiveness for the ReactJs project using TailwindCss

**Thoughts** For responsiveness, tailwindCSS is just the best. I learnt how to use the @apply rule for implementing tailwindCss utilities on an external css file.

### Day 13: June 29, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I am set to learn how to work with API's and form validation

**Thoughts** I am finding it difficult to integrate an API using ReactJS, well I would be making some bit of research to finally have a grasp of how it works.

### Day 14: June 30, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finally Worked with API integration using POSTMAN API

**Thoughts** it wasn't that easy as I thought it would.

### Day 15: July 1, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Resolved some post errors on form validation with the API

**Thoughts** Using the browser console I was able to track my post submission, checking if it was successful or not.

### Day 16 - 17: July 2-3, Saturday - Sunday

**Thoughts** Using the help of a peer I was able to debug the errors I was having with my code, hence was able to finish working on the authentication page for the Project.

### Day 18: July 4, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I started working on the dashboard of the project using react.

**Thoughts** It's quite easy and flexible to work with an existing UI than coming up with your default desings while coding the interface of an app.

### Day 19: July 5, Tuesday
