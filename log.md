### Day 1: June 17, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on command line and git commands using the terminal.

**Thoughts** It gave me some tough moments that I just want to close my laptop and do some other thing, well I believe that with constant practice I would be able to get at it and definitely become a pro with branching and merging my works using github.

### Day 2 & 3: June 18 - 19 , Saturday - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've not been able to code for a complete 2 days because I traveled to a new city in my country and I needed to settle before I could continue with my coding journey.

**Thoughts** It gave me some tough moments that I just want to close my laptop and do some other thing, well I believe that with constant practice I would be able to get at it and definitely become a pro with branching and merging my works using github.

### Day 4: June 20, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Took some time off to review my plan for the 100DaysOfCode Challenge and Did some study too.

**Thoughts** Its really to start and keep at a thing, most times constant motivation is a necessary factor.. well let's code atleast 1 hours every day that's the goal.
